# Linker

The **linker** will link the detected entities to a existing set of labels. Some of the **linkers**, however, are *end-to-end*, i.e. they don't need the **mentions extractor**, as they detect and link the entities at the same time.  

There are 5 **linkers** available currently, 3 of them are *end-to-end* and 2 are not.
